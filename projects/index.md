# General Themes

I have general interest in machine learning, especially [deep learning for natual language processing](http://www.socher.org/index.php/DeepLearningTutorial/DeepLearningTutorial). I am also interested in personalisation and web technologies, and the link with machine learning. I am open to suggested projects in these fields, drop me an [email](malito:Alexander.OConnor@scss.tcd.ie) to arrange a discussion.

## ADAPT Centre Projects

I am affiliated to the SFI [ADAPT Centre for Digital Content
Technology](http://www.adaptcentre.ie). There are a number of projects from the
areas of the centre, or including possible collaboration with industry partners
in the centre. If you have a topic you're interested in that fits that agenda,
please get in touch.

### Controlled Language

In industry, documents and other text are normally written to
particular style and content directives. This can include restricted
vocabularies, simplified sentence structures, or particular
readability requirements. This project would examine how content might
be written or re-written, with computer support, to better follow
these rules. It could include developing authoring software, enhancing
linguistic tools, and/or surveying authors, translators, and editors.

The project is co-supervised with an expert consultant from the
Localisation Industry, Dr. Fred Hollowood.

# Specific Projects

For each of these project topics, there is scope for a __Masters Practicum__, __Fourth Year Project__, or __Third year Project__.

## Entity Linking in Literary Fiction

Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation is a natural language processing task which concerns the recognition that certain words refer to _entities_ (People, places, times, events). Human language is highly referential and varied, and it can be difficult to decide precisely _which_ entity is being referred to.

A large amount of effective NLP is based on using journalistic, general content, where there is considerable [background knowledge](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march06/crane/03crane.html). This works well where the data being examined is also in a modern language and refers to modern things. A key challenge is where the collection of data is '[idiosyncratic](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2568013)': different in structure, vocabulary or size. This project would look at training a system to recognise entities such as characters, places and events in [narrative text](http://anthology.aclweb.org/W/W11/W11-41.pdf#page=80).

This project would look at disambiguating and linking character references in novels from the Gutenberg collection.

## Semantic Textual Similarity

This task is based on the [Semeval-2015 Task 2](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2015/task2/) and is concerned with the question:
     "Given two sentences, do they say the same thing, even if they use different words?", or "Are the different sentences in this pair equivalent?"

The task is interesting because some paraphrasing is extremely difficult to recognise, and creating a system that can find paraphrases without significant manual intervention would be of great value.

## Experiments in Word Embeddings

[Word Embeddings](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/) refer to the notion that by transforming free text into high-dimentional vectors, hidden meaning can be found. The benefit of doing this appears to be that the resulting vectors can be used for a variety of applications. One which has caught the imagination of researchers is the ability to infer relationships for different words. For example, it has been shown that a system can be trained that can answer ``"Rome"`` to the Equation ``"France - Paris + Italy"``, or ``"Queen"`` to the Equation ``"King - Man + Woman"``.

This project would look to explore the different possible uses for Word Embeddings, and in particular how to improve their consistency and reliability on different-sized collections of documents.

## Experiments in Reddit
Reddit is a large-scale, highly diverse, online community. Some possible
project ideas in this area include:

1. Evolution of language on reddits: how do specific terms appear and disappear
   in reddit discussions?
2. Inter-community spread: where do links appear first, and how are they spread
   across different reddits?

## Dual-Screen Websites

Modern Javascript allows realtime communication between different clients using
the [WebRTC standard](http://www.webrtc.org/). Two possible projects here:

1. Realtime web-based game development which accommodates both mobile and
   desktop
2. Web-based presentations controlled by the phone: developing a tool which can
   allow a presenter view on a phone (or other web browser page) to control a
slide deck.

## Interactive Infographics

Data-based story telling is a highly significant trend in journalism and in
media. This would look at the creation of tools for creating interactive
info-graphics that include features such as live data, adaptive views and
personalisation.
