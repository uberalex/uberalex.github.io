# Academic Papers

* [Replicable Evaluation of Recommender Systems](http://www.slideshare.net/abellogin/replicable-evaluation-of-recommender-systems)

    A lot of these issues also apply in other Machine Learning evaluation settings.

* [Recsys 2015 Session 1a: 'Users in the Loop'](http://recsys.acm.org/recsys15/session-1a/)

    Just letting the user feel in control hugely improves their satisfaction.

* [Network analysis of named entity interactions in written texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05281)

    There have been a number of studies of character networks in literature. One big challenge is the question of how reliable the NER performance is.

# General Links

* [On Manovich](http://www.publicseminar.org/2015/09/on-manovich/)

    The computer is the most general tool, the cognitive lever. Ultimately,
    everything people do is about either sending or receiving a signal. Kay's
    Smalltalk was quite literally about message passing between objects. Digital
    media puts people in the position of being receivers and senders, with far
    greater powers of interaction and manipulation in between.

* [Pointless Vocabulary Diversity and Grammatical Structure](http://chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2015/09/17/pointless-vocabulary-diversity-and-grammatical-structure/)

    It's a particular concern in academic, technical contexts, where the urge
    to create new words and terms is so strong. Jargon permeates, and sentences
    (thoughts?) simplify to accommdate and assuage the reader.

* [The Marshmallow Challenge](http://marshmallowchallenge.com/Welcome.html)

    Where Agile, Iterative methods can go wrong is that they either forget the marshmallow,
    or forget that is the goal.
