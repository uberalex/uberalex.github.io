## Academic Papers

*  [The Polylingual Labeled Topic Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06829)

    There is a lot of promise in the possibility that conceptual arithmetic. Different approaches to reasoning about word embeddings might prove a powerful approach to improving how systems reason about entities, rather than the strings that represent them. Another example of the power of word embeddings as a way to separate the conceptual signal from the linguistic noise.

* [DopeLearning: A Computational Approach to Rap Lyrics Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04771)

     One really clever aspect of this is the metric for quality relating to the rhyme density.

* [Relation Classification via Recurrent Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01006)

    LSTM seem to have a bit of a [unexpectedly strong ability to learn relationships and patterns at distance](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). Given the extraordinary resource requirements of a brute-force approach to word-level RNNs, some smarter strategy is presumably needed.

* [The Strange Case of Privacy in Equilibrium Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03080)

    There's [considerable controversy over the effect of 'objective' algorithms](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/upshot/when-algorithms-discriminate.html), in that they perhaps reflect some unpleasant features of collective behaviour. Users increasingly seem to distrust personalisation, but it's interesting to re-assess the assumptions about how to solve the unintended effects. After all, there's probably something to be learned and analysed about a user who visits a marketplace with full privacy settings, that's a stereotype that can be targeted like any other.




## General Links

* [How to Structure a Nature Summary Paragraph](http://t.co/xAhshxME1n) [Via @TrevorABranch](https://twitter.com/TrevorABranch/status/620699527486373888/photo/1)

    It's important to be able to do this. Communicating your research objectives, goals, methods, results and conclusions in this format is as good an exercise for the _author_ as it is for a reader.

* [How to Receive More Funding for Your Research? Get Connected to the Right People!](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133061)

    Science is increasingly collaborative, and sometimes that's not reflected in publications.It's not necessarily just about who you know, but who you know that you can _trust_.

* [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](http://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/)

    Both Javascript and Python have extensive functional features, and there is a lot of efficiency to be found in using FP approaches, even Java is moving that way.
