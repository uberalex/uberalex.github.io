* [On Manovich](http://www.publicseminar.org/2015/09/on-manovich/)

    The computer is the most general tool, the cognitive lever. Ultimately,
    everything people do is about either sending or receiving a signal. Kay's
    Smalltalk was quite literally about message passing between objects. Digital
    media puts people in the position of being receivers and senders, with far
    greater powers of interaction and manipulation in between.

* [Pointless Vocabulary Diversity and Grammatical Structure](http://chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2015/09/17/pointless-vocabulary-diversity-and-grammatical-structure/)

    It's a particular concern in academic, technical contexts, where the urge
    to create new words and terms is so strong. Jargon permeates, and sentences
    (thoughts?) simplify to accommdate and assuage the reader.

* [The Marshmallow Challenge](http://marshmallowchallenge.com/Welcome.html)

    Where Agile, Iterative methods can go wrong is that they either forget the marshmallow,
    or forget that is the goal.
